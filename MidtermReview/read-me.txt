Hello everyone,

Answers to the code problems will be posted after all sections have taken the
mock-up exam and have had a review session. Please see: /WEEK-05/midtermReview/answers/

I hope we will find as much time as possible to prepare for the midterm. 

I will answer emails on the weekend.

Good luck,
Duc
