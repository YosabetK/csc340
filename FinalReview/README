FINAL EXAM REVIEW

The answers to all of the review questions are provided and discussed in the 
review session(s). Similar questions were also in the Midterm mock-up answers, in Midterm 
exam answers, in the answers to course assignments (see the in-class presentations 
and the shared implementations/answers), and in the in-class handouts. We had
in-depth discussions when we read code and analyzed concepts together in class.
